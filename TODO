* connection manager
	- all sockets, with types (socks, dtls, tunnels and stuff)

* bootstrap manager:
	- by type/role. rename type to roles? seems to make sense.

* config
	- try to settle on a good hierarchy and names etc.

* libs
	- find a good logging module
	- fix stuff in nodedtls: API, printfs.
