* aqua core:
	- relay -> finish relay begin (missing ack). extend + extended. also need parse/ip6-to-bin to make this work.
	- relay -> need to implement the digest.
	- circuit mgr -> cell protocol: single path, multipath.
	- onioning: for now work with a hardcoded dir descriptor list. concentrate on onioning and take it from there. see tor dir-spec when the time comes.
	- nw errors. automatic reconnection.
	- see what exists in node for buffering/qos/shaping.

* testing:
	- automatic network simulation testing & benchmarking.
	- automatic unit testing & benchmarking.

* libs:
	- find a good logging module
	- fix stuff in nodedtls: API (host in opts), remoteAddr.
